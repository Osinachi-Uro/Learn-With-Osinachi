# Learn With Me

I created this repository to document my learning progress. I hope it helps you too, as you progress in your journey.

In the repository, I created folders for each exercise I completed.

Each exercise folder is serially numbered, starting from Exercise 1 to n. Below is a list of each exercise folder and its content, named based on the title of the topic learned.
